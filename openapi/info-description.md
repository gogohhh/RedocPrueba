This is an **example** API to demonstrate features of the OpenAPI specification.

# Introduction

Welcome to the DynamiCore API! You can use our API to access DynamiCore API endpoints, which can get information on various accounts in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

[OpenAPI/Swagger
format](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md).

It also demonstrates features of the
[create-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Redocly/create-openapi-repo) tool
and 

the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc) documentation engine. Beyond
the standard OpenAPI syntax, we use a few 

[vendor
extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/Redoc/blob/master/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

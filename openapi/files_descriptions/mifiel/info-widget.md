The signing widget is a tool that you can embed in your application so that stakeholders sign or approve documents in an iframe without leaving your website.

Note: It is not necessary for stakeholders to be registered in Mifiel In order to sign or approve a document.

To integrate it in your application, copy this <script src="https://www.mifiel.com/sign-snippet-v1.0.0.min.js"></script> and paste it before closing the </ body > tag in your page.

Each signer or reviewer of a document has a unique identifier to access the document. Make sure to insert the stakeholderâ€™s widget id (which you received when creating the document) so that the stakeholders visualize the correct document in the signing widget.

Note: If not the html code block click here!.
